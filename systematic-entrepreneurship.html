                                    as of 2020, the average startup failure rate in Africa stood at 54 percent.

                                    This was a very devastating fact considering that most graduates in Kenya and Africa as a whole defaulted to

                                    We started with paper sketches, which we later translated into user journeys on both milanote and figjam.

                                    of this process. I planned the wireframing sprints and led the sessions where the

                                    From the tests, it was clear that the usablity and user interface was performing well, but the content was not up to par yet. Most users complained that the educational content(which was mainly in video form) was not localised to the Kenyan and African audience. Examples included of foreign startups which did not have the same economic environment as Kenyan startups did.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Using this feedback, we came up with a couple of iterations to be done both at the time, and others in the next versions of the platform:

                                        We decided to target a more niche market; entreprenuers who were working on their ventures full time. This would allow us to work with entrepreneurs who were more committed and more likely to pay</p>

                                        <li><b>Importance of documentation:</b><br>
                                            During the process of research and coming up with the platform, we did not the best 
                                            documentation of insights, processes, roadmaps etc. This meant that we could not make 
                                            the data led decisions because there was no data. Bringing on additional members to the 
                                            team was also difficult since there was nothing for them to go through. I learnt to consider 
                                            documentation from the word go. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li><b>Incorporating business goals:</b><br>
                                            We unfortunately considered the business goals such as revenue and culture too late into the 
                                            process, and therefore those goals fought quite a bit with the user goals in the long run. 
                                            Considering the organizational goals is also very important at the start.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><b>Spending more time in design:</b><br>
                                            I believe we rushed through the design phase and it later affected us in the development 
                                            process; many changes and updates were being done during development which indicated that 
                                            we spent little time in testing at the design phase. Having enough feedback and passing 
                                            criterias that would indicate it was time to handover to deveopers is very important.
